  Install Instructions
  --
  1.Install the ipa with Filza(iOS 9 and 10) or sideloadly(iOS 8)
  
  ---These are only needed on iOS 9 and 10(and possibly 11 and 12 if it works there)
  
  2.Go to /var/containers/Bundle/Application/DDLC(if on filza)/DDLC-iOS.app/base
  
  3.tap on dokifix.sh then press continue

Supported Submods

Anything that supports the PC Version

Q:Are they bundled?
A:Install them yourself

Installing this requires AppSync Unified which you can get on cydia.akemi.ai
--
  
Save Files are stored on /var/mobile/Documents/RenPy/(iOS 8 and above) or /var/mobile/Application/<uuid>/Documents/(iOS 6 and 7)

I will not support Non-Jailbroken devices and any issues regarding them will be closed
